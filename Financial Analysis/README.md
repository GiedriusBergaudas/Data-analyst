# Retail Company Financial Analysis

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to evaluate and compare the financial performance of three major companies in the retail sector â€” **Walmart**, **Target**, and **Costco**.

## Methodology

The analysis is based on the following key financial ratios:

- **Return on Investment**
- **Gross Margin**
- **Return on Sales**
- **Current Ratio**
- **Quick Ratio**
- **Asset Turnover**
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**

To compare the companies in a consistent way, a **custom scoring model** was developed. Each ratio was assigned a specific weight based on its relevance in retail industry analysis. The final financial score for each company ranges from **0 to 100**.

## Outcome

The final scores provide a clear benchmark for evaluating which company currently shows stronger financial fundamentals relative to its peers.
